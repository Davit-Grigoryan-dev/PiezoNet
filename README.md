# PiezoNet

## PiezoNet: A data acquisition platform and database for data-driven characterization of piezoelectric resonators used in power electronics. The platform measures the voltage and the current over piezoelectric resonators across a wide range of excitation waveforms and ambient temperatures. The power stage dynamically adjusts to efficient operating points for best operation under different load conditions. This system is mechanically versatile, accommodating crystals of diverse materials and dimensions. The platform enables comprehensive and precise characterization by automating the data collection process, thereby providing extensive datasets essential for training data-driven models (e.g., neural networks) to predict operating points and nonlinear behaviors and to quantify the sample-to-sample variation of piezoelectric resonators. A family of sequence-to-sequence neural network models was trained and tested to validate the feasibility of data-driven models for piezoelectric resonators.
