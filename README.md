# PiezoNet

## PiezoNet: A data acquisition platform and database for data-driven characterization of piezoelectric resonators used in power electronics. The platform measures the voltage and the current over piezoelectric resonators across a wide range of excitation waveforms and ambient temperatures. The power stage dynamically adjusts to efficient operating points for best operation under different load conditions. This system is mechanically versatile, accommodating crystals of diverse material
